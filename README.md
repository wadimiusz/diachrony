# diachrony
This is the repository of the project that uses distributional semantics to track semantic shifts in words within short time spans.

You can use sh scripts in scripts/ folder to understand how to use the models.
E. g. for comparing embeddings from 2013 and embeddings from 2014 in a verbose manner, run:
```
sh scripts/comparison_2013_2014_informative.sh
```
