# diachrony

This is the repository of the workshop on tracking semantic shifts in languages by means of distributional semantics. The workshop was held at the Higher School of Economics. 

There were several projects within this workshop:

* https://github.com/wadimiusz/diachrony_for_russian
* https://github.com/ltgoslo/diachronic_multiling_adjectives

This repo contains our work on the workshop. It contains code related to both of the projects and cannot be considered a stable version.
